/*This program generates 2 random arrays of numbers based on the mega millions criteria.
  The first array, the winning numbers, is static.
  The Picked numbers are randomly generated each time the Picked numbers are != to the Winning numbers. 
  The counter is increased and shows how many times the Picked numbers are generated.

  This file has the ability to run for days with no solution due to the massive amount of possibilities. 
  A display keeps track of how many tries it has taken.

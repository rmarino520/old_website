/*
  This program shows the three main concepts of object oriented programming which are Polymorphism, Inheritance 
  and Encapsulation. In this program, I created a small user scenario which determines the outcome of the object.
  The class BossAttr contains 2 attributes that every boss in my scenario will have. (Encapsulation) The BossStats class 
  inherits all public properties that are conained within BossAttr. Once the user picks a number, a finalBoss object is created 
  with the BossStats variables being defined based upon what number the user picks. (Polymorphism) But each finalBoss object
  that is created will automatically inherit all properties from the BossAttr class. (Inheritence)

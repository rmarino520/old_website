		<h1>About me</h1>
		
<pre>My name is Robert Marino. I am currently a software tester and automation developer. I developed this website for two
reasons. The first reason being that while I know many back end development languages such as C++ and Java, I did not know any of 
the front end languages such as HTML and CSS. The second reason I developed this website is so that I have an easily accessable and 
maintainable portfolio. I have always been very good with computers since an early age, however, my passion for them didn't begin until 
about 5 years ago when I decided to learn Java. The first day I was learning how to code, I ended up coding and learning for almost 6 hours 
straight. I had not found something I enjoyed that much in a long time. I returned to SUNY Empire State College to get my Bachelors degree in 
computer science. I managed to complete the necessary curriculum of computer science classes in a little over 2 years, including one semester 
in which I took 21 credits of nothing but computer science courses. My passion for computers has not stopped. Since I have graduated, I continue 
to learn more about software and web development, database development, networking and security. I will be updating this website with more 
advanvced code and development techniques as my learning progresses.

Thank you for taking the time to view my website.

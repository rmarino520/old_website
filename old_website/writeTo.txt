/* The purpose of this program is to explore file manipulation using C#.
   The program gets the computers path to the desktop and creates a .txt file
   named WriteTo.txt. The maximum size is decided in bytes. This size can be changed
   in the future depending on the requirements of the user. 
   
   Once a maximum size is set, the program then writes random numbers to the file.
   This fills up the file 2 bytes at a time until the maximum size is reached. 
   While the progtam is writing to the file a display comes up to show how many bytes 
   have been written. Random numbers are used in this case but the program can be modified 
   in the future to accomidate whatever the user needs to write to the file.
